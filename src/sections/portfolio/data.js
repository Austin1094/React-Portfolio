They're able to search by category, state that it's held in, the start date, and the end date. Once the requirements are filled in, the list of events within the dates entered will show, along with a button to pin where at on the map it's located. From there, the user can click the pin on the map, and it will direct them Tickermaster, where they can then buy the tickets.",
